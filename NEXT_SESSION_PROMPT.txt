I'm working on a hackathon project called "UOH Academic Evaluation System" - an AI-powered document processing application. Here's the current status:

**PROJECT STRUCTURE:**
- Location: C:\Users\hp\UOH_Hackathon
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) - located in backend/
- Frontend: React + Vite - located in frontend/
- AI: Google Gemini + Cohere for document analysis
- Database: Supabase
- Storage: Excel exports

**CURRENT STATE:**
✅ Application works perfectly on localhost
✅ Backend runs on http://localhost:8000
✅ Frontend runs on http://localhost:5173
✅ All features working (upload, process, search, dashboard, AI query)
✅ Repository has been cleaned up of unnecessary docs

**API CONFIGURATION:**
Currently using localhost in 3 files:
1. frontend/src/App.jsx → const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
2. frontend/src/components/ResultsPage.jsx → const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
3. frontend/src/components/AIQueryPage.jsx → const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'

**WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:**
I want to deploy this application:
- Backend → Render.com
- Frontend → Vercel

**ISSUES I'M FACING:**
[Explain your deployment issues here]

**KEY FILES:**
- DEPLOY_SIMPLE.md (has deployment instructions)
- README_CLEAN.md (project documentation)
- requirements.txt (Python dependencies)
- render.yaml (backend deployment config)
- vercel.json (frontend deployment config)

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
- The Results tab issue was fixed by ensuring all components use the same API_URL
- CORS is configured in backend/api.py to allow Vercel domains
- The repository was cleaned of 35+ documentation files to reduce noise
- All source code is intact and working

Please help me with deployment issues or any other questions about the project.
