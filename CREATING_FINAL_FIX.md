# 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX - Creating Clean App.jsx

## Problem:
The current App.jsx has OLD placeholder versions of Results and AI Query pages defined inside it, which override the new clean components.

## Solution:
I'm creating a completely clean App.jsx that:
1. Imports the NEW component files
2. Does NOT redefine them inside
3. Has Sidebar and Homepage

## Quick Commands:

```bash
# Stop frontend: CTRL+C

# I'll create the fix file now...
# Then restart with: npm run dev
```

Please wait 30 seconds while I create the perfect file...
