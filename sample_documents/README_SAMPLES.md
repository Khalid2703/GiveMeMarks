## 🚀 How to Use in Presentation

### Step 1: Convert to PDF (Optional but Recommended)

If you have time, convert these .txt files to PDFs for more realistic demo:

**Option A - Using Microsoft Word:**
1. Open .txt file in Word
2. Format if needed
3. File → Save As → PDF

**Option B - Use them as-is:**
Your system can handle .txt files too!

### Step 2: Upload Documents

Three approaches:

**Approach A - Individual Upload:**
- Upload one sample at a time
- Show processing for each
- Good for explaining specific document types

**Approach B - Batch Upload:**
- Upload 2-3 samples together
- Show batch processing capability
- Faster for time-constrained demos

**Approach C - Full Batch:**
- Upload all 6 samples
- Show system handling multiple document types
- Best for impressive full demo

### Step 3: Present Results

**While Processing (10 seconds):**
Say: "The AI is now analyzing these documents using Google Gemini. It's extracting student information, academic performance, courses, and more."

**After Processing:**
1. Point to Document Status: "All 6 documents processed - 100% success rate"
2. Show Students Table: "Here we can see 6 different students extracted"
3. Highlight variety: "Notice different programs - B.Sc, B.Tech, M.Sc, M.Tech"
4. Click Download: "All this data is now in a formatted Excel file"

### Step 4: Open Excel

**Sheet 1 - Student Data:**
- Show all 6 students in rows
- Point out different fields populated
- Highlight: "Different document types, but system extracts relevant info"

**Sheet 2 - Course Details:**
- Show course-wise grades
- Multiple semesters, different subjects
- Properly linked to students
